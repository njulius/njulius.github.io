title: "The Effect of Teacher Gender on Students of Differing Ability: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/njulius_jmp
excerpt: 'Using data from a well-executed field experiment, I study heterogeneity in the impact of teacher gender on students of differing ability by implementing the Conditional Average Treatment Effect estimator of Abrevaya et al. (2015). I find that female students see a limited degree of heterogeneity in the effect of teacher gender, while male students see almost none. My results suggest that estimates of the average effect of teacher gender do not mask significant heterogeneity, and can thus be used to motivate policy without exacerbating inequality between students of different abilities.'
