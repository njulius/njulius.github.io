I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Iowa State University. My research deals with the causal impact of teacher gender on students, focusing on heterogeneous impacts. I have a secondary interest in econometric methods for causal analysis.

My [job market paper](https://njulius.github.io/files/njulius_jmp.pdf) estimates the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) of being assigned a female teacher on male and female students of differing ability. I implement the CATE estimator proposed by [Abrevaya et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2014.975555) using data from the National Evaluation of Teach for America. I find limited heterogeneity in the effect of teacher gender on female students, but no heterogeneity for male students. This suggests that estimates of the average effect of teacher gender can be used to motivate policy without exacerbating inequality between students of different ability.
