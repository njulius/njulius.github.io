## The Effect of Teacher Gender on Students of Differing Ability: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment

**Abstract**: Using data from a well-executed field experiment, I study heterogeneity in the impact of teacher gender on students of differing ability by implementing the Conditional Average Treatment Effect estimator of [Abrevaya et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2014.975555). I find that female students see a limited degree of heterogeneity in the effect of teacher gender while male students see almost none. My results suggest that estimates of the average effect of teacher gender do not mask significant heterogeneity, and can thus be used to motivate policy without exacerbating inequality between students of different abilities.

## Matching as Weight Selection: A Framework for Evaluating Matching Estimators

**Abstract**: Matching estimators provide an intuitively appealing approach to program evaluation. Due to the non-smooth nature of matching algorithms, the bias/variance trade-off from switching between different matching methods is opaque, leaving practitioners with little guidance when choosing a matching algorithm or smoothing parameters. I cast matching estimators as a subset of a larger class of weighting estimators and consider infeasible optimal weights. I use the insights derived from this to identify areas in which certain matching procedures have clear advantages or disadvantages.

## A Note on Bootstraps for Matching Estimators

**Abstract**: Matching estimators are a popular approach to program evaluation in empirical literature. [Abadie and Imbens (2008)](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA6474) showed that the naive bootstrap fails to provide valid inference on such matching estimators, and conjectured that a wild bootstrap might solve this problem. [Otsu and Rai (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2016.1231613) confirm this conjecture for the general case. I consider a simpler bootstrap and demonstrate that even with significantly stronger assumptions, their bootstrap cannot be improved. Simulations provide further support for this conclusion.
